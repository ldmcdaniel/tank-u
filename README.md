# tower-defense

Version 1.0 includes has working independent towers on click with tanks that have health greater than 1.  In version 2 I would like to include:
  A bit of grass covering the title screen title and exploding to reveal the title.
  More than 1 wave of tanks.
  A button that appears between waves to trigger the release of the next wave of tanks.
  Tanks with varying degrees of health and boss tanks.
  Working tokens to purchase and upgrade turrets with different options.
  Upgrades to turrets with greater range, increased damage, varying bullet speeds and sound effects.
  Convert all .wav files to .mp3.
  An endgame state.
